# Project Repository

This repository contains three folders with Jupyter Notebook files for different projects:

- `Multi-layer-Network_Jiajian`
- `MTS_routes-Matthew`
- `OSM_Project_Steve_S`

## How to Run the Code

To run the code in each project:
1. Navigate to the desired folder.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file directly using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code.

Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed (e.g., via `pip install notebook` or `pip install jupyterlab`) and the required dependencies listed in each notebook.
